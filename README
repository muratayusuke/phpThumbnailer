Note
----
Version of GD library older than gd-1.6 support GIF format images, and do not
support PNG images, where versions greather than gd-1.6 support PNG, not GIF.

In order to create thumbnails in JPEG format, you will need to obtain and
install jpeg-6b library, and then recompile gd to make use of jpeg-6b. You
will also have to compile PHP with --with-jpeg-dir=/path/to/jpeg-6b.
